# PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY

## Core Technology

X-energy has developed the **Xe-100**, a Generation IV High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) small modular reactor (SMR) that delivers 80 MWe per unit, typically deployed in "4-Pack" configurations (320 MWe). This next-generation nuclear solution combines two key proprietary elements:

1. **Advanced Reactor Design:** The Xe-100 utilizes helium coolant to achieve high temperatures (565°C) while maintaining passive safety. Its modular, factory-fabricated components are road-shippable, enabling faster construction than conventional nuclear plants.

2. **Proprietary TRISO-X Fuel:** Each fuel kernel is triple-encapsulated in carbon and ceramic layers within graphite "pebbles," creating an inherently safe containment system that withstands temperatures >1,600°C and eliminates the need for large containment domes.

## Value Proposition

The Xe-100 addresses critical market challenges that neither conventional nuclear nor renewables can fully solve:

- **Surging Electricity Demand:** Projected 150% increase by 2050 driven by electrification, AI/data centers, and industrial growth
- **Decarbonization Requirements:** Need for 24/7 reliable, carbon-free power
- **Industrial Process Heat:** Hard-to-abate sectors requiring high-temperature steam

X-energy's solution provides unique advantages:

- **Dual-Purpose Output:** Delivers both baseload electricity and industrial-grade steam (565°C)
- **Enhanced Safety:** "Walk-away safe" design with passive shutdown mechanisms
- **Reduced Footprint:** Smaller emergency planning zones enable siting near industrial users
- **Accelerated Deployment:** Factory fabrication cuts construction timelines from >8 years to ~3-4 years
- **Industrial Decarbonization:** High-temperature capability unlocks applications in chemicals, steel, and hydrogen production

A single 320 MWe deployment at Dow's Seadrift site is projected to eliminate 440,000+ tons of CO₂e annually.

## Technical Moats & Defensibility

X-energy has established multiple barriers to competition:

1. **Proprietary Know-How:** 14 years of specialized expertise in HTGR design and TRISO-X fabrication across 400+ technical staff
2. **Vertical Integration:** In-house fuel manufacturing creates independence from third-party suppliers
3. **IP Portfolio:** 10 patent applications in 2024, expanding to 32 by 2033, covering reactor design, fuel composition, and manufacturing processes
4. **Customer Lock-In:** 60+ year lifecycle service, fuel replenishment, and regulatory support create high switching costs
5. **Regulatory Advantage:** Early engagement with NRC and DOE validation provide head start in licensing process

## Key Technical Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Regulatory Approval Delays | Nuclear licensing processes are complex and often extend timelines | Early, proactive NRC engagement; leveraging DOE program learnings; robust project controls |
| TRISO-X Manufacturing Scale-Up | Achieving commercial volumes of next-gen fuel at required quality | In-house facility with phased production ramp; advanced QA/QC protocols |
| HALEU Supply Chain | Securing sufficient high-assay low-enriched uranium feedstock | Leveraging $700M+ government investment in domestic HALEU supply; DOE contracts |
| First-of-Kind Construction Risk | Cost overruns common in novel nuclear deployments | 80% off-site fabrication; factory QA/QC; modular construction approach |
| Public Perception | Local resistance to nuclear facilities | Brownfield/industrial siting; proactive community engagement; smaller emergency planning zones |

## Conclusion

X-energy's Xe-100 represents a step-change in nuclear technology, combining advanced safety features, modular deployment, and high-temperature capabilities to address critical market needs for clean baseload power and industrial decarbonization. With strong technical validation, strategic partnerships, and multiple defensible moats, the company is well-positioned to lead the commercialization of next-generation nuclear solutions.
