# Customer Discovery

## Target Customer Segments & Pain Points

X-energy targets two primary customer segments experiencing acute energy challenges:

* **Large Industrials** (chemicals, steel, hydrogen, data centers) requiring high-grade process heat and reliable baseload power
* **Utilities/IPPs** with aging, retiring baseload fleets and limited low-carbon alternatives

These customers face a critical energy trilemma:

1. **Rising Demand:** Global electricity needs projected to increase 80-150% by 2050 (IEA)
2. **Decarbonization Mandates:** Regulatory, investor, and customer pressure for immediate carbon reductions
3. **Reliability Requirements:** Need for 24/7 "always-on" power and industrial process heat

Current solutions fail to address these combined needs:
* **Legacy Nuclear:** Prohibitive capital costs, decade-long deployments, and large site requirements
* **Fossil Generation:** Increasing carbon penalties and price volatility
* **Renewables:** Intermittency prevents consistent baseload power or process heat capabilities

## Market Validation & Customer Evidence

X-energy has secured significant commercial traction with blue-chip customers:

* **Dow Chemical** selected X-energy's Xe-100 SMR for its Seadrift, TX facility, projected to cut 440,000 MT CO₂e annually when no viable alternatives could decarbonize both process heat and power
* **Tech Giants** including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are actively procuring 24/7 nuclear power, signaling demand for reliable, carbon-free energy unreachable by other sources
* **Fortune 500 Steel** and other industrial companies are advancing joint projects and detailed engineering studies

> "The collaboration with X-energy and the DOE will serve as a leading example of how the industrial sector can safely, effectively and affordably decarbonize." —Jim Fitterling, Dow Chairman & CEO

## Customer Discovery Process & Methods

X-energy employs a rigorous, multi-faceted approach to customer discovery:

* **Targeted Customer Interviews:** Deep engagements with industrial offtakers to validate specific needs around process heat, siting, and risk tolerance
* **Pilot & Feasibility Projects:** Up to $50M in engineering work per project prior to full construction, including site-specific economic, regulatory, and technical validation
* **Signed Joint Development Agreements:** Commercial agreements requiring substantial financial and resource commitment pre-permit, pre-build
* **Third-Party Validation:** Selection for the $1.2B DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (one of two recipients) demonstrates competitive differentiation

## Evidence of Demand & Willingness to Pay

Quantitative metrics demonstrate strong customer commitment:

* **Signed Commercial Agreements:** JDAs and MOUs representing ~11 "4-pack" SMRs (hundreds of MWs, pipeline value $40.7B by 2033) with anchor customers including Dow, Energy Northwest, and Ontario Power Generation
* **Hard Dollar Commitments:** Customers investing up to $50M per site in pre-permit engineering work, years before commercial operation
* **Deployment Timeline:** First 320 MWe project at Dow Seadrift (construction start 2026, COD by 2030), followed by projects in Washington State and Ontario
* **Pipeline Growth:** Committed projects scale from 1 to 11 (2024-2033), with cumulative deployed capacity projected to reach 1.6 GW by 2033

Notably, several major customers (Dow, Energy Northwest, OPG) are also investors in X-energy, further aligning incentives and demonstrating conviction.

## Market Catalysts & Why Now

Several converging factors create an optimal market entry window:

1. **Data Center/AI Expansion:** Forecasted doubling of North American data center electricity demand by 2030 requires 24/7 firm, carbon-free power—a need uniquely suited for nuclear SMRs
2. **Coal Plant Retirements:** Hundreds of GW scheduled for retirement by 2030 create ready-made sites with existing infrastructure and grid connections
3. **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The ADVANCE Act (2024) streamlines NRC approvals and establishes frameworks for advanced reactors
4. **Financial Incentives:** IRA production and investment tax credits plus $700M+ for US HALEU fuel production materially de-risk projects
5. **Technology Readiness:** Completion of decades-long R&D in high-temperature gas reactors now enables first commercial deployments with competitive economics

This convergence of customer urgency, technological readiness, and policy support creates a unique market opportunity that wasn't present even five years ago.

## Summary

X-energy's customer discovery demonstrates compelling demand from high-value segments who face urgent energy challenges. The company's robust pipeline, significant commercial commitments, and customer willingness to pay validate strong product-market fit. With established first-mover advantages and powerful market catalysts, X-energy is positioned to capitalize on a clear inflection point for SMR commercialization and scale.
